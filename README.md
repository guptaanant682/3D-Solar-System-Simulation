Solar System 3D Simulation

  Created by: Anant Gupta (Infinity)

  Overview

  An interactive 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js that provides a realistic visualization of our solar system with all 8 planets, Earth's
  moon, asteroid belt, and various interactive features.

  Features

  Core Solar System

  - Sun: Central star with realistic glow effect
  - 8 Planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
  - Saturn's Rings: Detailed ring system around Saturn
  - Earth's Moon: Orbiting around Earth with realistic motion
  - Asteroid Belt: 200+ asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
  - Starfield Background: 5000+ stars for realistic space environment

  Interactive Controls

  - Mouse Controls: Orbit around the solar system, zoom in/out with scroll wheel
  - Planet Focus: Click on any planet to smoothly focus the camera
  - Pause/Resume: Control animation playback
  - Reset Camera: Return to default viewing position
  - Theme Toggle: Switch between dark and light themes

  Advanced Features

  - Planet Trails: Visual trails showing orbital paths (toggleable)
  - Orbit Lines: Guides showing planetary orbits (toggleable)
  - Time Speed Control: Adjust simulation speed from 0.1x to 5x
  - Individual Planet Speed: Control each planet's orbital speed independently
  - Real-time Animation: Smooth 60fps animation with proper physics

  Visual Elements

  - Realistic Colors: NASA-based planetary colors
  - Proper Lighting: Point light from sun with shadows
  - Hover Tooltips: Planet information on mouse hover
  - Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices

  Technology Stack

  - Three.js: 3D graphics rendering
  - JavaScript: Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
  - HTML5 Canvas: Rendering surface
  - CSS3: Styling and responsive design
